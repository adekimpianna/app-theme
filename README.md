## Introduction
This is a homework project for module 2: Incremental Development in coding school [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium) year 2020. <br>
The **App Theme** project belongs to **Code along** category of projects in HFY, which means, as per my understanding, that **the project is decided by the course** and **we just need to follow the code as the given example,** any creativity outside of the example given is welcome but not mandatory. This time example is [**App Theme design by Traversy Media**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlA7dputiNc).

### What are the goals?
This project assignment, according to me, has these objectives for us:
* To be able to develop the **Development Strategy** and work accordingly as per [**Agile Values**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzzkpAOxHXs). <br>
  With this method, we do not have to put or finish the project all together to show our work. Instead **we develop the project step by step and propose it right after per step is done.**
  In that way, other parties can see our progress more clearly and it is easier for us to adjust where the project leads to.
  In order to reach this goal, we are going to make branches to show the steps and a related user story or what is needed to be done in each branch.
* To be able to make **a website**, as per instructions of HFY, by applying study materials learnt about HTML and CSS, especially **Responsive Design with FlexBox**
* Another goal is to get used to **Collaborative Workflow** on Github that is represented by mastering Pull Request, Resolving Conflict and Merge the files containing changes via Github.

### Who should do it?
* Anyone who is interested in Agile Way as a project (IT) development
* Beginners in website developing
