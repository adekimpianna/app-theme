# Development Strategy

> App-theme: Code Along

* From the [**wireframe**](#wireframe) we can see the HMTL layout that will be covered in this project and then we are going to create respective styles for the websites based on the wireframes. 
* Here you can also see how the project is developed step by step (0-x) as per Agile values, through [**branches**](#0.set-up) that each contains a user story or persona in marketing (visitor perspective and their needs). We can see what has to be done in each branch in order to answer to the user story and its needs. Then we apply it to the development our pages.
